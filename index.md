# Professional Experience
## Feb. 2019 -- today. Research Intern and Master Student, Shared project in the Divisions of [Bioinformatics and Omics Data Analytics](https://www.dkfz.de/en/bioinformatik-omics/index.php) (Dr. Matthias Schlesner) and  [Computational Genomics and System Genetics](https://www.dkfz.de/en/bioinformatik-genomik-systemgenetik/index.php) (Dr. Oliver Stegle) at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg GE
In the groups of Dr. Schlesner and Dr. Stegle at DKFZ we are interested in the analysis and integration of multi-modal omics data types to investigate the contribution of biological variation in contexts like the evolution of cell types and tumor formation/progression. I currently work on the application and development of data integration and machine learning approaches to single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq data.


 ## Apr.--Sep. 2018, Research Intern, [Division of Mechanics of Cellular Signaling](https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/diz-munoz/ ), Dr. Alba Diz--Muñoz, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, GE
 In the Diz--Muñoz Group at EMBL we developed fusion proteins and inducible linker proteins to influence membrane-to-cortex attachment in mammalian cell lines. These molecular tools were designed to enable the investigation of cellular responses to mechanically transduced signals. My responsibilities included the design and development of novel linker proteins, molecular cloning, cell culture techniques and a screening method based on light&fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, I introduced a method to cross link fusion proteins with covalent bonds.


## Nov. 2017--Mar. 2018, Research Internship, [Division of Systems Genetics of Cancer](http://www.http://markowetzlab.org/), Dr. Florian Markowetz, Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute/ University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK
We could obtain a model of the functional hierarchy of a transcription factor complex in breast cancer cells. This yielded novel biological insights into how the components of the complex functionally relate to each other. In our work we used a Baysian approach to gene perturbation data (RNAi, followed by bulk RNA-seq). The method was implemented in the R programming language.

## Sep.--Oct. 2017, Research Assistant, [Division of Applied Bioinformatics](http://www.dkfz.de/en/applied-bioinformatics/index.php), Dr. Benedickt Brors, DKFZ
As a student research assistant in Dr. Brors' group at the DKFZ I was contributing to a NGS data processing pipeline using Bash scripting.

## Apr.--Jul. 2017, Research Internship, [Division of Genome Regulation](http://ki.se/en/bionut/genome-regulation-patrick-cramer), Visiting Professor Dr. Patrick Cramer, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, SE
In a computational systems biology internship at the Karolinska Institute we were annotating active enhancers from transient transcriptome sequencing data using the textitR/Bioconductor environment and Bash scripting. We also quantified enhancer RNA transcripts and used them as a surrogate parameter to quantify enhancer activity.


## Okt.-- Dec. 2016, Research Internship, Dr. Christian Klein, [Department of Medicinal Chemistry](http://www.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de/chemie/klein/index.html) at the University of Heidelberg
Under supervision of Dr. Tom Sundermann I developed novel Dengue virus protease inhibitor candidates. I synthesized candidate compounds, performed NMR and MassSpec measurements and used enzyme based assays to test the compounds.

## Apr. 2016 -- Sep. 2016, Tutor & Supervisor,[Apprenticeship Center, TUM](https://www.berufsausbildung.tum.de/startseite/), Munich, GE 
As a Supervisor at the TUM Apprenticeship Center I was teaching and mentoring young apprentices for laboratory professions. This included the theoretical and practical teaching, e.g. on chemical synthesis, microbiology and molecular biology, as well as preparing and conducting the welcome seminar week.

## Nov. 2014 -- Feb. 2016, Research Assistant & Bachelor Student, [Chair of Biochemistry, TUM](http://www.biochemie.ch.tum.de/index.php?id=873), Dr. Sabine Schneider
Aim of our work was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the split--intein mediated protein trans--splice reaction. The main methods we applied were molecular cloning, recombinant protein expression&purification, protein crystallization, data collection at a synchrotron radiation facility (supervised) and protein structure determination using molecular replacement (supervised).


## 2008 -- 2011, laboratory assistant in the field of chemistry (voccational training)
Before I started my studies I was trained as a laboratory assistant in the field of chemistry. This voccational training consisted of three years full time work in a company accompanied by theoretical and practical training. Although officially embodied in the TUM the['Forschungszentrum für Brau- und Lebensmittelqualität'](http://www.blq-weihenstephan.de/) took part in the market as an independent company. 

In addition to a solid working routine in a professional working environment I could gain practical skills in the lab, among which were:
- classical microbiological and molecular biological methods
- organic chemical synthesis
- physical, chemical and biochemical assays
- instrumental & trace--analytics including GC, HPLC, IC, AAS, ICP and MassSpec
- quality management and GLP
